### Lab Genie
Anyone who has worked in a modern lab knows that it's unthinkable without computerized data acquisition and software-enabled controls. However, finding free, user friendly software even for something as simple as PID temperature control can be a challenge. The Lab Genie software, having been developed in a physics and chemistry laboratory, addresses several experimental needs:
* Reading and recording analog voltage signals and temperature
* Running closed-loop PID temperature control
* Controlling Hiden HAL Quadrupole Mass Spectrometers (QMS)
* Running Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) experiments with Hiden HAL QMS
